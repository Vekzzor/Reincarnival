# Reincarnival
A personal side project where I make multiple mini-games, either original concepts or recreate old classic with potential twists. The project was inspired from a work test where I was tasked to create a space invaders game.

Started games:
* a basic version of Space Invaders.

Future Ideas:
* Breakout game with a curved pad moving in a circular shape around with multiple curved bricks creating a circle in the center for the player to remove.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
